Fans of the gay comedy genre can rejoice as, following Nicholas Stoller’s 'Bros' in 2022, the second feature from Emma Seligman tells a story featuring likable and confident characters, already cemented in their sexuality rather than the more drama-friendly approach of teens struggling with what their orientation means to them.

Featuring 'Shiva Baby's' Rachel Sennot and 'The Bear's' Ayo Edebiri, high school lesbians PJ and Josie's insistence on losing their virginities before college leads them to clumsily start a self-defense club at their school to hook up with cheerleaders. The film's tone primarily addresses any concerns raised by this scheme, in which characters frequently act as if they're in a full-fledged spoof rather than a tongue-in-cheek comedy. Still, the ease with which their morally grey plan unfolds raises concerns that can be offputting in one's mind while watching a comedy.

Fortunately, the tone above is spot-on in the other rom-com mainstays. The main characters are instantly likable, and Sennot and Edibiri's well-honed camaraderie is evident, with several scenes benefiting from improvisation. Other standouts include Ruby Cruz as the more grounded third friend, who plays the part of a straight-laced contrast to the cartoonish world in which the other characters exist.

This cartoonish tone is essential for how the girl's plan escalates in the context of a comedy, as headbutts and haymakers are dismissed as minor inconveniences in the pursuit of empowerment. While the individual characters have unique and relatively realistic motivations for embracing violence early on, the cartoonishness takes center stage by the final.

The film's main flaw is the completely unavoidable main buddies fall out, then reconnect the plotline. By this point, PJ has established herself as a weapons-grade jerk, so rooting for her redemption feels arbitrary, and it's difficult to root for her return without feeling like a less conventional outcome would have landed better. Although, in the context of many character interactions being purposefully unrealistic, it unfortunately fits the bill.

I wish I liked the characters as much as I like the actor's previous iterations of 'playing themselves.' Still, a slightly uneven tone and the decision to shoehorn in previously unseen antagonists brought this down for me. You'll find a lot to like if you can get past the nitpicking and enjoy the film on its merits.
