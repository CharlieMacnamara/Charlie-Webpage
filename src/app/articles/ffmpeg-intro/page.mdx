FFmpeg is a robust multimedia tool that I learned about during my first job as a Technical Writer. At Transloadit (The first company I worked for), FFmpeg was integrated into their feature stack, enabling users to manipulate images, videos, and audio using FFmpeg's parameters when the API didn't natively support specific functions.

I was also a Support Engineer during my final year with Transloadit, and I would deal with many requests for creating custom ffmpeg parameters. Imagine an on request demo like [this](https://transloadit.com/demos/audio-encoding/ffmpeg-distant-audio/).

I've recently been using FFmpeg in a project and quickly realised I remembered less than I expected, so I wanted to do a write-up to cement some of the skills I've gained from reteaching myself while also making something informative for those unfamiliar.

## Getting Started

Whether you need to convert audio formats or perform advanced video editing, FFmpeg's a straight shot. In this article, I'll help you get started, demonstrate common use cases, and showcase the power of FFmpeg.

## Installing FFmpeg on Windows

### Step 1: Download FFmpeg for Windows

Begin by visiting the FFmpeg [download page](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)., and click the "Windows builds from gyan.dev" link. In the "git master builds" segment, select the ffmpeg-git-full-7z link (the complete build with the latest libraries).

While this guide references the gyan.dev build, alternative builds work similarly.

### Step 2: Extract the Downloaded Files Using WinRAR

Navigate to the location of your downloaded file and extract the contents, renaming the outputted folder to "ffmpeg." Move this folder to the root of your C: drive or another directory.

### Step 3: Integrate FFmpeg into Windows PATH

Search for "system variables" using the search bar and choose "Edit the system environment variables." In the subsequent window, click "Environment Variables..." then under the "User variables" tab, locate and select "Path," then click "Edit." Click "New" and add `C:\ffmpeg\bin to the path`.

### Step 4: Verify Your FFmpeg Installation

To ensure FFmpeg is working correctly, open Command Prompt or PowerShell and enter:

```shell
ffmpeg
```

Details about your FFmpeg version will be displayed if everything is set up correctly.

## Getting Started

Before diving into specific commands, let's look at some foundational concepts:

The basic syntax of the FFmpeg command is `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.mp4`. Hereâ€™s an explanation for the commands:

- `ffmpeg`: This calls the program.
- `-i`: This identifies the input file.
- `input_url`: This specifies the input file URL.
- `output_url`: This specifies the output file URL.

In the examples, I've used `sample.mp4` as a placeholder. Replace it with the name of your actual file. The same is true for output files. Also, ensure the specified input file exists in your working directory, or FFmpeg will throw an error and prompt you to confirm you're in the correct directory in the command line.

### 1\. Adding a Watermark

Watermarks can be crucial for branding or context. This command places the 'Your Watermark' text on the top-right corner of the video, saved as `output_watermarked.mp4`. Adjust text properties as needed.

```shell
ffmpeg -i sample.mp4 -vf "drawtext=fontfile=/Windows/fonts/calibri.ttf:fontsize=60:fontcolor=white:x=W-tw-10:y=10:text='Your Watermark'" output_watermarked.mp4
```
<DynamicPlayer mediaUrl="https://charliewebsite.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/output_vp9.webm" mediaType="video" />

### 2\. Format Conversion

Converting media formats couldn't be easier. This command converts `sample.mp4` to AVI format, resulting in `output.avi`.

```shell
ffmpeg -i sample.mp4 output.avi
```
if you run `ls *.avi`, you will see the following:
```shell
output.avi
```

### 3\. Removing Audio from Video

To remove a video's audio stream, include the `-an` flag.

```shell
ffmpeg -i sample.mp4 -an output_silent.mp4
```
<DynamicPlayer mediaUrl="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70JP38JO8wo" mediaType="video" />

### 4\. Combining Audio and Video

Combine a video and external audio files by mergingÂ `output_silent.mp4` and `track.mp3` into a single video.Â The video codec remains unchanged, and the audio codec is set to AAC.

```shell
ffmpeg -i output_silent.mp4 -i track.mp3 -c:v copy -c:a aac -strict experimental output_combined.mp4
```

<DynamicPlayer mediaUrl="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOuI6tFFbAc" mediaType="video" />

### 5\. Extracting Specific Duration from Video

To extract a specific segment, use the -ss flag to set the segment start time along with the -t flag to select the duration from the starting time:

```shell
ffmpeg -i sample.mp4 -ss 00:00:05 -t 00:00:10 output_segment.mp4
```

<DynamicPlayer mediaUrl="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeg2Qm1zmm4" mediaType="video" />

### 6\. Speed Alteration

This command doubles the speed of `sample.mp4`. Modify the multiplier to control speed:

```shell
ffmpeg -i sample.mp4 -vf "setpts=0.5*PTS" -af "atempo=2.0" output_fast.mp4
```

<DynamicPlayer mediaUrl="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwkn_XdTfbw" mediaType="video" />

### 7\. Video Resizing

This command resizes the video to 1280x720 pixels. Adjust values as needed. Reducing resolution decreases file size without compression:

```shell
ffmpeg -i sample.mp4 -vf "scale=1280:720" output_resized.mp4
```

Inspecting the output shows the resize was successfull:

```shell
Source Image Width              : 1280
Source Image Height             : 720
```

## Video Compression

Effective video compression is essential for reducing file sizes while maintaining quality, a technique I've used for this blogðŸ˜„ It's particularly crucial for streaming and cloud storage, though it involves a trade-off between file size and quality.

Experiment with `-crf` values for optimal results and explore various codecs. Below I've shared an example using the H.264 (AVC) codec, renowned for its high-quality output at lower bit rates, is perfect for storage and streaming.

```bash
ffmpeg -i sample.mp4 -vcodec libx264 -crf 40 output_compressed264.mp4
``` 
This shrank my 27MB input file to 2MB.

### Reasons to Convert & Compress

- **Compatibility:** Different devices and platforms may require specific formats.
- **Quality vs. Size:** Compression balances quality and file size.
- **Editing:** Lossless formats like WAV preserve quality during edits.
- **Streaming & Storage:** Efficient compression is crucial for cloud storage and streaming.

## Multiple Task Execution in One Command

FFmpeg's strength lies in executing multiple tasks in a single command. Everything just discussed can be combined to create some pretty cool stuff.

These commands showcase FFmpeg's efficiency and flexibility in handling multiple tasks simultaneously. Understanding FFmpeg's flags and options empowers you to create powerful commands tailored to your multimedia needs.

```shell
ffmpeg -i sample.mp4 -ss 00:00:05 -t 00:00:10 -vcodec libx264 -crf 30 batchoutput_segment.avi
```

## Final Thoughts

The commands I've gone over barely scratch the surface of what FFmpeg is capable of - it's a potent tool. I would suggest thoroughly reading through FFmpeg's documentation, as there are undoubtedly thousands of cases that I haven't talked about. Thank you for reading, and if you would like to see some of my other ffmpeg creations, you can view the Transloadit demos on my portfolio page.
