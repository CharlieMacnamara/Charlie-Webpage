I've always found traditional sourdough methods demanding. You know the type— feeding schedules, precise temperatures, and needless faff. So, I developed something different.

I'm sure this isn't the "Charlie" method, but I have to start the fame somehow: a hybrid approach that combines a biga (Italian for sponge) pre-ferment with sourdough starter. 

Here's my complete process, from mixing to final proof.

<TableOfContents />

This hybrid approach offers several advantages:

1. Extended fermentation (up to 36 hours) develops deep, complex flavors.
2. Parallel fermentation of biga and sourdough creates multiple flavor profiles.
4. Flexible timing works around your schedule, not the other way around.

Adding diastatic malt powder might seem fancy, but another small detail makes a big difference. It provides extra food for the yeast and helps achieve that beautiful golden crust we all strive for.

## Day One: Setting Up The Ferments

### The Morning Biga

Everything starts with a biga—a pre-ferment that brings complexity to our final loaf. The recipe is straightforward:

- 750g flour
- 450g water
- A pinch of dry yeast
- A touch of brown sugar

    {
      src: "/bread-blog/images/day1-3.jpg",
      alt: "Adding water to the biga mixture"
    }
  ]}
/>

The process begins with combining our ingredients. That tiny bit of commercial yeast might raise eyebrows among purists, but it's our insurance policy—providing reliable fermentation while still allowing for complex flavor development.

Here's a quick look at the mixing process:

## Day Two: The Main Event

### The Sourdough Mix

<SingleImage 
  src="/bread-blog/images/day2-1.jpg"
  alt="Starting our sourdough journey with the initial ingredients"
  orientation="horizontal"
/>

While the biga is just getting started, we prepare our sourdough portion. Here's where my unconventional "scraping method" comes in. Instead of maintaining a constantly fed starter, I keep a small amount in the fridge and scrape what I need—think of it as sourdough concentrate.

<TwoColGrid
  images={[
    {
      src: "/bread-blog/images/day2-3.jpg",
      alt: "Scraping the refrigerated starter"
    },
    {
      src: "/bread-blog/images/day2-4.jpg",
      alt: "Reactivating the starter"
    }
  ]}
/>

To this scraped starter, we add:
- Additional flour
- Water
- Diastatic malt powder
- Organic salt (more on this surprising ingredient later)

Now comes the magic—the biga and sourdough sit out together, developing their flavors in parallel. This extended fermentation (up to 36 hours) is where the complexity builds. You'll notice both mixtures becoming more alive as time passes.

By the evening of day one, you'll start to see significant activity—bubbles forming, aromas developing, and the texture becoming more complex.

### A Note About That Salt

Here's something that surprised me: organic salt is a thing. Regarding harvesting and processing, not in the "NaCl can be organic" sense (it can't—it's a mineral). We're talking unrefined sea salt, certified clean waters, and no anti-caking agents. Small details? Yup. Bread's all about the details.

## The Final Stage: Shaping and Proofing

Time for the final steps. The dough goes through a series of folds to develop strength and structure. Each fold develops strength.

    {
      src: "/bread-blog/images/day2-7.jpg",
      alt: "First fold of the dough"

    },
    {
      src: "/bread-blog/images/day2-9.jpg",
      alt: "Final fold showing developed strength"
    }
  ]}
/>

Then comes shaping, where we create the structure defining our final loaf.

<TwoColGrid
  images={[
    {
      src: "/bread-blog/images/day2-15.jpg",
      alt: "Pre-shape stage"
    },
    {
      src: "/bread-blog/images/day2-17.jpg",
      alt: "Final shaping"
    }
  ]}
/>

The shaped loaves rest in bannetons, continuing their development.

      alt: "Loaves in bannetons"

    {
      src: "/bread-blog/images/day2-23.jpg",
      alt: "Close-up of dough development"
    }
  ]}
/>

Finally, the loaves go into the fridge for their cold-proof, adding one final layer of flavor development.

  images={[
    {
      src: "/bread-blog/images/day2-27.jpg",
      alt: "Preparing for cold proof"

      alt: "Loaves ready for overnight refrigeration"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Day Three: Scoring and Baking

After the cold-proof, it's time for the easiest part to mess up. The dough has developed complex flavors and strength, and now we'll give it character through scoring and high-heat baking. This stage requires precision timing and careful attention to temperature control.

### Preparing for the Bake

<SingleImage

  alt="Baking steel setup with steam pan"
  variant="diagram"
  caption="The key elements: baking steel for heat retention, steam pan below for the perfect crust development."
/>

The secret to achieving that perfect crust? It's all about the environment in your home oven. Here's my setup:

1. Position your baking steel in the middle rack.
2. Place a heavy-duty pan on the bottom rack for steam generation.
3. Place a pan on the bottom rack for boiling water.
4. Preheat everything to maximum temperature for 40 minutes (250°C/480°F)

Your workspace should have:
- A lame or any sharp blade
- A pizza peel or wide board
- Heat-resistant gloves
- A spray bottle with water
- Boiling water for steam

### The Art of Scoring

<SingleImage 
  src="/bread-blog/images/diagrams/day3-scoring.png"
  alt="Bread scoring technique diagram"
  variant="diagram"
  caption="The classic scoring pattern: one decisive slash at 45° creates the perfect 'ear'"
/>

Scoring isn't just for looks—it's functional art. A proper score controls how your loaf expands during that crucial initial spring. Get this right, and you'll create that "ear" expansion.

Key scoring principles:
- Hold your lame at a 45-degree angle.
- Make decisive, confident cuts about 1/4 inch deep.
- Score just before transferring to the hot oven
- Keep decorative scores more shallow than your main score.

    {

      focusArea: "center",

    }
  ]}
/>

### The Inferno

<SingleImage 
  src="/bread-blog/images/day3-6.jpg"
  alt="Bread scoring technique diagram"
  orientation="vertical"
  zoom={1.5}
/>

This is the moment of truth. Your timing here is crucial—every second counts:

1. Slide your scored loaf onto the hot steel.
2. Pour boiling water into the steam pan.
3. Spray water into the oven.
4. Close the door fast—we're capturing steam!

The baking process:
1. **Steam Phase (30 minutes)**
   - Full steam environment
   - Temperature at 250°C (480°F)
   - Maximum oven spring is happening now.
   
2. **Crust Development (15-20 minutes)**
   - Remove the steam pan.
   - Drop temperature to 230°C (450°F)
   - Rotate the loaf 180 degrees.
   - Watch for color development.

### The Big Reveal

The transformation during the crust development phase is remarkable. Watch as your loaf develops:
- A deep caramelized crust
- A pronounced "ear" was scored.
- A beautiful contrast between dark and light areas

### Waiting

Be patient for optimal results:

1. **Initial Cooling (15 minutes)**
   - Remove from oven.
   - Place on a wire rack

2. **Complete Cooling (1-2 hours)**
   - Resist the temptation to cut early.
   - Allow the crumb to set completely.

Why wait?
- Cutting too soon can make the crumb gummy.
- Steam needs to redistribute through the loaf.
- The crust develops its final texture.
- Flavors become more pronounced.

### Always Improving

Bread-making is a journey of constant learning and adaptation. While this method might evolve, its core principles of patience, attention to detail, and respect for fermentation will remain constant. Whether you're a sourdough purist or a curious baker looking to experiment, remember there's no single "right" way to make bread. The best method is the one that works for you and brings joy to your baking process.

Next time you're in the kitchen, consider trying something unconventional. You might discover your perfect method and learn something surprising about salt.
