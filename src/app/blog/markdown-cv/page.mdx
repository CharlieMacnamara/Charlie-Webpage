After the recent overhaul of my website, I found myself staring at my CV 
thinking, "This sucks, eh?" You know how it goes - one project leads to another. Why not ensure consistency?

After spending what felt like ages tweaking margins in Google Docs (we've all been there), 
I thought there had to be a better way. So I built this little tool that combines the 
simplicity of Markdown with the power of Tailwind CSS. Under the hood, it's running on 
Node.js and Express, with Puppeteer doing the heavy lifting for PDF generation. Simple, 
but it gets the job done nicely.

## The Problem

We've all been there - switching between different CV formats, trying to keep everything 
consistent. It's one of those things that's always worth improving and there's no need to pay for a nice looking CV.

Fun fact: this project was born from my Â£60 mistake with resume.io. I forgot to cancel my 
subscription after a free trial, and six months later... Well, let's just say that expensive 
oversight motivated me to build something better. Now I can laugh about it (mostly).

## The Solution

Enter my Markdown CV Generator - a simple tool that takes your CV written in Markdown and 
transforms it into a pretty PDF. Here's how it works:

1. Write your CV in Markdown
2. Run a simple command
3. Get a professionally styled PDF that actually looks good

## The Markdown

Make sure you have your resume text at hand; edit the layout for other sections. Here's what the Markdown looks like:

<div className="my-8 overflow-hidden rounded-xl border border-zinc-200 bg-white dark:border-zinc-700/40 dark:bg-zinc-900/70">
  <div className="border-b border-zinc-200 bg-zinc-50 px-4 py-2 dark:border-zinc-700/40 dark:bg-zinc-800/70">
    <span className="font-mono text-sm text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400">markdown</span>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 bg-white/80 text-zinc-800 dark:bg-zinc-900/70 dark:text-zinc-200">
```markdown

## Quickstart.

Getting started is straightforward. First, clone the repo:

<div className="my-8 overflow-hidden rounded-xl border border-zinc-200 bg-white dark:border-zinc-700/40 dark:bg-zinc-900/70">
  <div className="border-b border-zinc-200 bg-zinc-50 px-4 py-2 dark:border-zinc-700/40 dark:bg-zinc-800/70">
    <span className="font-mono text-sm text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400">bash</span>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 bg-white/80 text-zinc-800 dark:bg-zinc-900/70 dark:text-zinc-200">
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Markdown-CV-Generator.git
cd Markdown-CV-Generator
npm install
```
  </div>
</div>

Then, edit the example.md file and run:

<div className="my-8 overflow-hidden rounded-xl border border-zinc-200 bg-white dark:border-zinc-700/40 dark:bg-zinc-900/70">
  <div className="border-b border-zinc-200 bg-zinc-50 px-4 py-2 dark:border-zinc-700/40 dark:bg-zinc-800/70">
    <span className="font-mono text-sm text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400">bash</span>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 bg-white/80 text-zinc-800 dark:bg-zinc-900/70 dark:text-zinc-200">
```bash
markdowncv build --default
```
  </div>
</div>

That's it! Your CV will be generated as a PDF.

<div className="my-8">
  <Image 
    src={cvOutput} 
    alt="Example CV output showing a clean, professional design" 
    className="rounded-xl shadow-lg dark:shadow-zinc-800/30"
    priority
  />
</div>

## What's Next?

This is all open source. Customize to your heart's content. Want to 
add your own theme? Create a new CSS file in the themes directory.

I'm planning to add more themes, and maybe even a web 
interface for those who prefer clicking to command lines. If you have any suggestions or want 
to contribute, access the [repo](https://github.com/CharlieMacnamara/Markdown-CV-Generator).
