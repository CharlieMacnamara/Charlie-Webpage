After the recent overhaul of my website, I found myself staring at my CV 
thinking, "This sucks, eh?" You know how it goes - one project leads to another. Why not ensure consistency?

After spending way too much time tweaking margins in Google Docs, I thought: "Why not leverage 
Markdown and Tailwind CSS to create something better?" Built using Node.js and Express for the backend, with Tailwind CSS for styling. Puppeteer handles the PDF generation.


## The Problem

We've all been there - switching between different CV formats, trying to keep everything 
consistent. It's one of those things that's always worth improving and there's no need to pay for a nice looking CV.

Fun fact: this project was born from my Â£60 mistake with resume.io. I forgot to cancel my 
subscription after a free trial, and six months later... Well, let's just say that expensive 
oversight motivated me to build something better. Now I can laugh about it (mostly).

## The Solution

Enter my Markdown CV Generator - a simple tool that takes your CV written in Markdown and 
transforms it into a pretty PDF. Here's how it works:

1. Write your CV in Markdown
2. Run a simple command
3. Get a professionally styled PDF that actually looks good

## The Markdown

Here's what the Markdown looks like :

<div className="my-8 overflow-hidden rounded-xl border border-zinc-200 bg-white dark:border-zinc-700/40 dark:bg-zinc-900/70">
  <div className="border-b border-zinc-200 bg-zinc-50 px-4 py-2 dark:border-zinc-700/40 dark:bg-zinc-800/70">
    <span className="font-mono text-sm text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400">markdown</span>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 bg-white/80 text-zinc-800 dark:bg-zinc-900/70 dark:text-zinc-200">
```markdown

## Quickstart.

Getting started is straightforward. First, clone the repo:

<div className="my-8 overflow-hidden rounded-xl border border-zinc-200 bg-white dark:border-zinc-700/40 dark:bg-zinc-900/70">
  <div className="border-b border-zinc-200 bg-zinc-50 px-4 py-2 dark:border-zinc-700/40 dark:bg-zinc-800/70">
    <span className="font-mono text-sm text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400">bash</span>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 bg-white/80 text-zinc-800 dark:bg-zinc-900/70 dark:text-zinc-200">
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Markdown-CV-Generator.git
cd Markdown-CV-Generator
npm install
```
  </div>
</div>

Then, edit the example.md file and run:

<div className="my-8 overflow-hidden rounded-xl border border-zinc-200 bg-white dark:border-zinc-700/40 dark:bg-zinc-900/70">
  <div className="border-b border-zinc-200 bg-zinc-50 px-4 py-2 dark:border-zinc-700/40 dark:bg-zinc-800/70">
    <span className="font-mono text-sm text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400">bash</span>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 bg-white/80 text-zinc-800 dark:bg-zinc-900/70 dark:text-zinc-200">
```bash
markdowncv build --default
```
  </div>
</div>

That's it! Your CV will be generated as a PDF.

<div className="my-8">
  <Image 
    src={cvOutput} 
    alt="Example CV output showing a clean, professional design" 
    className="rounded-xl shadow-lg dark:shadow-zinc-800/30"
    priority
  />
</div>

## What's Next?

This is all open source. Customize to your heart's content. Want to 
add your own theme? Create a new CSS file in the themes directory.

I'm planning to add more themes, and maybe even a web 
interface for those who prefer clicking to command lines. If you have any suggestions or want 
to contribute, access the [repo](https://github.com/charlie-macnamara/markdown-cv).
