After the recent overhaul of my website, I found myself staring at my CV 
thinking, "This sucks, eh." Why not ensure consistency?

So I built this little tool. It combines the 
simplicity of Markdown with the power of Tailwind CSS. Under the hood, it's running on 
Node.js and Express, with Puppeteer for PDF generation. Simple.

## The Problem

Resumes are one of those things; always worth improving. Unfortunetly, google docs template designs suck. You've probably looked for a replacement. No need to fall for that oximoron. The end goal is getting a job. 

Fun fact: this project was largely born from my Â£60 mistake with resume.io. I forgot to cancel my 
subscription after a free trial, and six months later... Well, let's just say that expensive 
oversight motivated me.

## The Solution

Enter Markdown CV Generator - title work in progress - a simple tool to build your CV. Here's how it works:

1. Write your CV in Markdown
2. Run command
3. Get a professionally styled resume

## The Markdown

Make sure you have your resume text at hand; edit the layout for new additional sections. Here's the Markdown:

<div className="my-8 overflow-hidden rounded-xl border border-zinc-200 bg-white dark:border-zinc-700/40 dark:bg-zinc-900/70">
  <div className="border-b border-zinc-200 bg-zinc-50 px-4 py-2 dark:border-zinc-700/40 dark:bg-zinc-800/70">
    <span className="font-mono text-sm text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400">markdown</span>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 bg-white/80 text-zinc-800 dark:bg-zinc-900/70 dark:text-zinc-200">
```markdown

## Quickstart.

Getting started is straightforward. First, clone the repo:

<div className="my-8 overflow-hidden rounded-xl border border-zinc-200 bg-white dark:border-zinc-700/40 dark:bg-zinc-900/70">
  <div className="border-b border-zinc-200 bg-zinc-50 px-4 py-2 dark:border-zinc-700/40 dark:bg-zinc-800/70">
    <span className="font-mono text-sm text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400">bash</span>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 bg-white/80 text-zinc-800 dark:bg-zinc-900/70 dark:text-zinc-200">
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Markdown-CV-Generator.git
cd Markdown-CV-Generator
npm install
```
  </div>
</div>

Then, edit the example.md file and run:

<div className="my-8 overflow-hidden rounded-xl border border-zinc-200 bg-white dark:border-zinc-700/40 dark:bg-zinc-900/70">
  <div className="border-b border-zinc-200 bg-zinc-50 px-4 py-2 dark:border-zinc-700/40 dark:bg-zinc-800/70">
    <span className="font-mono text-sm text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400">bash</span>
  </div>
  <div className="p-4 bg-white/80 text-zinc-800 dark:bg-zinc-900/70 dark:text-zinc-200">
```bash
markdowncv build --default
```
  </div>
</div>

That's it! Your CV will be generated.

<div className="my-8">
  <Image 
    src={cvOutput} 
    alt="Example CV output showing a clean, professional design" 
    className="rounded-xl shadow-lg dark:shadow-zinc-800/30"
    priority
  />
</div>

## What's Next?

This is all open source. Customize away. Create new CSS designs in the `themes` directory.

I'm planning to add more themes - maybe a web 
interface. If you have any suggestions or want 
to contribute, access [here](https://github.com/CharlieMacnamara/Markdown-CV-Generator).

Thanks!
